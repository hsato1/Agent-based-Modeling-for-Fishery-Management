## Summary
This agent-based modeling for fishery management through emergence, simulates migration movement of Atlantic Mackerel based on real world environmental data such as sea surface temperature, sea surface velocity, and phytoplankton density which is a proxy for food availability. 

Why is this project important?/Why does this matter?

Fisheries in the United States contributes significantly to our economy by generating over 1.5 millon jobs. Fishery management agencies such as NOAA Fisheries conducts stock assessments to manage a good ecological balance and enforce restrictions to sustain good ecological balance and protect the ecosystem. Maintaining the good health of fishery is correlated to maintaining good economy balance. Therefore conducting efficient stock assessments without permanently damaging the ecosystem is crucial.

How is this project different from previous work done by other researchers
Boyd et al [1] highlight that traditionally ecologists fit the available data into mathematical models to estimate thebenchmarks that are
used to evaluate the current stock status. Mathematical models disregard
